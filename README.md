## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
6. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result is shown in the file tidydata.txt
